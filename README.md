### What is this app?


What started out as a quest to emulate a Jordanian card game called *'Hand'* resulted in an exploration in building a simple card game to get my feet wet. This game is a very simplified version of *'Hand'* (building sets of cards) with a *roulette* premise. At the beginning of the game, a card is drawn by both the player & the computer known as the 'death card' and is not known to either. Any cards added to the player/computer's set matching the death card will result in an automatic loss. In order to win, you must build your set to be worth **51** or more points before the computer.
